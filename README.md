Brain Disease Classification
Brain disease Classification 
• Developed an automated system using deep learning techniques to classify 
brain diseases, specifically Alzheimer’s Disease, from MRI scans. 
• Gathered and preprocessed a diverse dataset of MRI scans, ensuring data 
quality and uniformity through normalization, resizing, and augmentation. 
• Designed and implemented deep learning models, leveraging convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to extract features 
and classify brain diseases accurately. 
• Trained and evaluated the models using rigorous methodologies, achieving 
high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying different stages of 
Alzheimer’s Disease and other brain diseases.
